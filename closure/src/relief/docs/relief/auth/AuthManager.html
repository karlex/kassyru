managers.  It extends EventTarget with the expectation that its subclasses
will accept listeners for and dispatch authentication events such as login
and logout.</p>extends <a href="../../goog/events/EventTarget.html">goog.events.EventTarget</a><table class="method-list"><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Instance Method Summary</strong></td></tr><tr><td class="method-list-cell method-access method-public"></td><td class="method-list-cell method-cell"><code>getCurrentUser(function ((null|relief.auth.User)): ? callback)</code><br><p class="method-description">In addition to letting clients add listeners for auth/auth events,
AuthManager provides the ability to directly query the object for its

This method requires a callback since it is possible it will be called while
a request to the server for these details is being made.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
