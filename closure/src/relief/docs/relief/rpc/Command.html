goog.Disposable because the retention of the client's onSuccess and
onFailure callbacks may create a memory leak.  The RPC service will dispose
the command object after its `onSuccess`, `onCacheHit`, or `onFailure` method
returns.</p>extends <a href="../../goog/Disposable.html">goog.Disposable</a><table class="method-list"><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Instance Method Summary</strong></td></tr><tr><td class="method-list-cell method-access method-protected"></td><td class="method-list-cell method-cell"><code>disposeInternal()</code><br><p class="method-description">Deletes or nulls out any references to COM objects, DOM nodes, or other

Not reentrant. To avoid calling it twice, it must only be called from the
subclass' {@code disposeInternal} method. Everywhere else the public
{@code dispose} method must be used.
For example:
<pre>
mypackage.MyClass = function() {
goog.base(this);
// Constructor logic specific to MyClass.
...
};
goog.inherits(mypackage.MyClass, goog.Disposable);

mypackage.MyClass.prototype.disposeInternal = function() {

value was stored for the given keys, the server request is executed.

Subclasses that set readFromCache to true must define a getCacheKeys method.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="method-list-cell method-access method-public"></td><td class="method-list-cell method-cell"><code>getCacheValues() &#8658; ?Array</code><br><p class="method-description">When a response comes back from the server for a cacheable request, the
RPC service will call onSuccess so that the command object can perform
whatever processing it needs (including execution of the client's callback).
Once onSuccess returns, the RPC service calls this method to obtain the
cache keys and values that should be stored.

This method will only ever be called after the command's onSuccess method
was called.

If, on a future request, the RPC service finds a value for the cache keys,
the values returned by this method will be what is passed to the command
object's onCacheHit method.

This method must return an array of record objects with a "key" attribute
(this should be the same string as returned by getCacheKeys); and a "value"
attribute, which is the value to be stored in the cache.

The RPC service always stores items in the cache by value, meaning that
the value attribute of this method's returned object must either implement
relief.cache.Cloneable (ie., it has a clone() method) or it must be cast
to a relief.cache.SimpleValue.  See documentation for rpc.cache.Cache
for details on using these interfaces.

Subclasses that set writeToCache to true must define a getCacheValues method.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="method-list-cell method-access method-public"></td><td class="method-list-cell method-cell"><code>getCommandID() &#8658; string</code><br><p class="method-description">Get the CommandID for this command object.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="method-list-cell method-access method-public"></td><td class="method-list-cell method-cell"><code>getData() &#8658; (string|undefined)</code><br><p class="method-description">This method is called by the RPCService when formulating the call to the

instead of onSuccess.  This allows getCacheValue to pre-process the response
and store the value back in the cache in such a way that future cache hits
can avoid any expensive re-processing.

onCacheHit will receive a copy of whatever the previous getCacheValue
returned.  This method should be able to return a response to the command's
client from the cached value.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="method-list-cell method-access method-public"></td><td class="method-list-cell method-cell"><code>onFailure(?goog.net.XhrManager.Event event)</code><br><p class="method-description">This method is called by the RPCService on a failed response.

For simpler implementations, onFailure can simply be a pointer to the
onSuccess method, but this is discouraged for more complex logic.

All subclasses must define an onFailure method.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="method-list-cell method-access method-public"></td><td class="method-list-cell method-cell"><code>onPartialCacheHit(?Array vals)</code><br><p class="method-description">When a command's getCacheKeys() method returns an array with more than one
key, the RPC service iterates over the keys and fills an array with
record objects with the same structure as those returned by getCacheValues.
If only some of the keys returned by getCacheKeys are found, this method is
called to allow the command object to tailor its request parameters (url and
content data) to only request the missing information.  After this method is
called, the RPC service will check the command object's url property and call
getData, then execute the server trip.

If a command class' getCacheKeys() method will never return more than one
key, this method does not have to be defined.  If, however, getCacheKeys()
could potentially return more than one key, this method should be
implemented.

If all of the keys returned by getCacheKeys() were found in the cache, this
method will not be called.  The RPC service will, instead, route directly to
onCacheHit.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="method-list-cell method-access method-public"></td><td class="method-list-cell method-cell"><code>onSuccess(?goog.net.XhrManager.Event event)</code><br><p class="method-description">This method is called by the RPCService on a successful response.

the appropriate CommandResponse object.
